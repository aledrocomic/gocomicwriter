// Package storage implements project persistence and indexing.
// It handles create/open/save for the canonical JSON manifest (comic.json) with transactional writes and timestamped backups.
// It also manages the perâ€‘project embedded SQLite index at <project>/.gcw/index.sqlite used for search and caches.
// The embedded index is derived from comic.json and assets and is rebuildable/disposable by design.
